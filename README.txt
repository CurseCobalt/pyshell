version: 0.1.0

this is a python shell i made because i was bored.
this is really bad and unfinished, but my friend told me to post
it on github.

also, english is not my first language, so dont expect my grammar
to be good.

how it works:
basically a terminal/shell.

#btw, anything inside <> is to be replaced with what it means, and
anything inside () explains the keyword does.

keywords:
print <string> (prints your string)
exit (ends the program)
set <var name> <value> (asigns a value to a variable.
accepts strings, ints, floats and bools)
printvar <var name> (prints the value of your variable)
math <on/off> (toggles between doing math and executing code)
new (asigns a storage a value. examples:
new var <name> <value>
new array <name> <value>
new dict <dict name> <key> <value>
)
// <text> (a comment. doesnt execute anything)
WIPs:
(only currently active) look <storage name or path> (doesnt work
properly)
WIPs not available:
cd <storage name or path> (enters a storage)
delete <storage name or path> (deletes a storage)
